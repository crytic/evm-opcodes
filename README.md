# Ethereum VM (EVM) Opcodes and Instruction Reference

This reference consolidates EVM opcode information from the [yellow paper](http://gavwood.com/paper.pdf), [stack exchange](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/119/what-opcodes-are-available-for-the-ethereum-evm), [solidity source](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/c61610302aa2bfa029715b534719d25fe3949059/libevmasm/Instruction.h#L40), [parity source](https://github.com/paritytech/parity/blob/d365281cce919edc42340c97ce212f49d9447d2d/ethcore/evm/src/instructions.rs#L311), [evm-opcode-gas-costs](https://github.com/djrtwo/evm-opcode-gas-costs/blob/master/opcode-gas-costs_EIP-150_revision-1e18248_2017-04-12.csv) and [Manticore](https://github.com/trailofbits/manticore/blob/c6f457d72e1164c4c8c6d0256fe9b8b765d2cb24/manticore/platforms/evm.py#L590).

New issues and contributions are welcome, and are covered by bounties from Trail of Bits. Join us in #ethereum on the [Empire Hacking Slack](https://slack.empirehacking.nyc) to discuss Ethereum security tool development.

## Notes

The size of a "word" in EVM is 256 bits.

The gas information is a work in progress. If an asterisk is in the Gas column, the base cost is shown but may vary based on the opcode arguments.

## Instruction Details

### ADD

Takes two words from stack, adds them, then pushes the result onto the stack.

Pseudocode: `push(s[0]+s[1])`

### PUSHX

The following X bytes are read from PC, placed into a word, then this word is pushed onto the stack.

### CALL
